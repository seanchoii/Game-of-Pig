            Each player takes turns rolling a single die and <br>
            the roll results are added to the score. <br> <br>
            Each player takes turns rolling a single die <br>
            and the roll results are added to the score <br><br>
            - If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing <br>
            and it becomes next player's turn <br><br>
            - If the player rolls another number, it is added <br>
            to their turn total and the player's turn continues <br><br>
            - If the player decides to hold, their turn is over <br>
            and their turn total is added to the total score <br><br>
            This game continues this way until a player reaches <br>
            100 total points. Then the game is over.
